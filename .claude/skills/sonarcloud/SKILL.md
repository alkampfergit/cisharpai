# SonarCloud Quality Skill

This skill handles reading, analyzing, and fixing SonarCloud issues reported on
pull requests. SonarCloud runs as a GitHub App and reports results as PR checks
and comments.

## Memory

This skill maintains persistent memory in `memory/` within this skill directory.
After each session, update memory files with:
- New issue patterns encountered and how they were resolved
- Project-specific SonarCloud rules that frequently trigger
- Files that are chronic hotspots for issues

Before starting work, always read memory files to leverage past experience.

## When to use this skill

| User says... | Action |
|---|---|
| "check sonarcloud" / "quality gate" | [Read PR Issues](#read-pr-issues) |
| "fix sonarcloud issues" / "fix code smells" | [Fix Issues Workflow](#fix-issues-workflow) |
| "sonarcloud is failing" / "quality gate failing" | [Diagnose Quality Gate](#diagnose-quality-gate) |
| "check duplication" / "fix duplication" | [Fix Duplication](#fix-duplication) |

## Read PR Issues

### Step 1 -- Find the PR

```bash
# List open PRs
gh pr list --state open

# Get PR checks status
gh pr checks <pr-number>
```

### Step 2 -- Read SonarCloud results

**Primary method: SonarCloud public API** (most reliable, returns structured JSON):

```bash
# Get all issues for a PR -- no authentication needed for public projects
curl -s "https://sonarcloud.io/api/issues/search?componentKeys={owner}_{repo}&pullRequest={pr-number}&statuses=OPEN,CONFIRMED&ps=50"
```

This returns structured JSON with full issue details: rule, severity, message, file, line number, effort.

**Fallback: GitHub check runs** (summary only, no individual issue details):

```bash
# IMPORTANT: The app slug is "sonarqubecloud" (NOT "sonarcloud")
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha}/check-runs \
  --jq '.check_runs[] | select(.app.slug == "sonarqubecloud") | {name, conclusion, summary: .output.summary}'
```

**Note**: The SonarCloud bot comment may not always be present on PRs. The check run summary and the direct API are more reliable.

### Step 3 -- Parse the results

From the SonarCloud API response, extract for each issue:
- **rule** -- the SonarCloud rule ID (e.g., `typescript:S3776`)
- **severity** -- MINOR, MAJOR, CRITICAL
- **message** -- human-readable description
- **component** -- file path (strip the `{project_key}:` prefix)
- **line** -- line number
- **type** -- BUG, VULNERABILITY, CODE_SMELL
- **impacts** -- softwareQuality + severity (e.g., MAINTAINABILITY/HIGH)

Present a concise summary table to the user.

## Fix Issues Workflow

### Step 1 -- Categorize issues

Group SonarCloud issues by type:
1. **Bugs** -- Fix first (highest impact)
2. **Vulnerabilities** -- Fix second
3. **Code smells** -- Fix third
4. **Duplication** -- Fix last (see [Fix Duplication](#fix-duplication))

### Step 2 -- Plan fixes with parallel safety

**CRITICAL**: Check memory for known conflict hotspots before assigning work.

When using parallel agents to fix issues:
- **Partition by file** -- each agent gets exclusive files, never overlapping
- **Never modify shared hub files** in parallel (e.g., `src/index.ts`, `package.json`)
- **Cross-cutting refactors** (extracting shared helpers, renaming across files) must be done sequentially, not in parallel

Safe parallel pattern:
```
Agent 1: fixes in src/commands/get-md-field.ts + tests/unit/get-md-field.test.ts
Agent 2: fixes in src/commands/set-md-field.ts + tests/unit/set-md-field.test.ts
Agent 3: fixes in src/services/html-detect.ts + tests/unit/html-detect.test.ts
```

Unsafe parallel pattern (AVOID):
```
Agent 1: extracts shared helper from get-item.ts, set-field.ts, assign.ts
Agent 2: fixes duplication in get-item.ts, set-state.ts
-- CONFLICT: both touch get-item.ts
```

### Step 3 -- Apply fixes

For each issue:
1. Read the affected file
2. Understand the SonarCloud rule being violated
3. Apply the minimal fix (don't over-refactor)
4. Run `npm test && npm run lint` to verify

### Step 4 -- Verify

```bash
# Run full check suite
npm test && npm run lint && npm run typecheck

# Commit and push
git add <specific-files>
git commit -m "Fix SonarCloud issues: <brief description>"
git push
```

After pushing, the SonarCloud check will re-run automatically on the PR.

### Step 5 -- Update memory

After fixing issues, update `memory/patterns.md` with:
- Which rules triggered and how they were fixed
- Any new hotspot files identified

## Diagnose Quality Gate

When the quality gate fails, check these common causes:

1. **Coverage on new code < threshold** -- Need more tests
2. **Duplication on new code > threshold** -- See [Fix Duplication](#fix-duplication)
3. **New bugs/vulnerabilities** -- Must be zero for gate to pass
4. **New code smells above threshold** -- Reduce count

```bash
# Quick check: is the quality gate the only failing check?
gh pr checks <pr-number>

# Get detailed quality gate status via SonarCloud API (preferred)
curl -s "https://sonarcloud.io/api/issues/search?componentKeys={owner}_{repo}&pullRequest={pr-number}&statuses=OPEN,CONFIRMED&ps=50"

# Or via GitHub check runs (summary only, slug is "sonarqubecloud")
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha}/check-runs \
  --jq '.check_runs[] | select(.app.slug == "sonarqubecloud") | .output.summary'
```

## Fix Duplication

Duplication is the most common quality gate failure in this project.

### Detection

SonarCloud flags duplicated blocks (usually 10+ lines of identical or near-identical code).

### Common duplication patterns in this project

1. **Command boilerplate** -- ID parsing, org/project validation, error handling
   repeated across command files
   - **Fix**: Extract to shared helpers (already done in `src/services/command-helpers.ts`)

2. **Test setup** -- Same mock setup repeated across test files
   - **Fix**: Extract to shared test utilities in `tests/unit/helpers/`

3. **API call patterns** -- Similar fetch/auth/error patterns
   - **Fix**: Use shared `fetchWithErrors` from `azdo-client.ts`

### Duplication fix strategy

1. Identify the duplicated blocks from SonarCloud report
2. Find all instances in the codebase using Grep
3. Extract shared code into a helper/utility
4. Replace all instances with calls to the shared code
5. Ensure tests still pass

**Important**: Duplication fixes are cross-cutting refactors. Do them
**sequentially**, not in parallel agents. See [parallel safety](#step-2----plan-fixes-with-parallel-safety).

## Common SonarCloud Rules for This Project

| Rule | What it means | Typical fix |
|---|---|---|
| S1192 | String literal duplication | Extract to constant |
| S3358 | Nested ternary operations | Extract to if/else or helper function |
| S3776 | Cognitive complexity too high | Extract helper functions |
| S1481 | Unused local variable | Remove it |
| S6551 | Avoid String() on object types | Use explicit toString() or template literal |
| S6606 | Ternary instead of nullish coalescing | Use `??` operator |
| S7735 | Unexpected negated condition | Flip condition or use `??` |
| S7780 | Backslash escaping in strings | Use `String.raw` tagged template |
| typescript:S107 | Too many parameters | Use options object |
| Duplication | Code blocks repeated | Extract shared helper |

## Troubleshooting

**SonarCloud check not appearing on PR**
- SonarCloud GitHub App may need to be re-authorized
- Check if the PR targets a branch SonarCloud is configured to analyze

**Quality gate passes locally but fails on SonarCloud**
- SonarCloud analyzes the diff against the target branch, not the full codebase
- Coverage and duplication thresholds apply only to new/changed code

**SonarCloud reports issues in files you didn't change**
- This can happen with duplication -- if you copied code from an existing file,
  both the source and destination are flagged
- Fix: refactor the shared code into a common location
